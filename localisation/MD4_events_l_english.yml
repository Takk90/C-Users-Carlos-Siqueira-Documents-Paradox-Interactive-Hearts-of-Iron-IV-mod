Keep in mind that predicting the future is difficult and hard work so it may be that our experts are wrong. \nWe would, of course, never dream to give your excellency orders on what to do, but making some adjustments now will be less painful than a full blown crisis in the future."

 econvent.2.t:0 "Collapsing housing prices"
 econvent.2.d:0 "As the prices of houses and apartments have went through the roof, especially in the last year, people have taken out larger and larger loans to afford housing, while speculators have invested heavily in property, also using loaned money. Right now, this is coming to an end, fast. The prices are dropping, and people are trying to sell like there is no tomorrow. Many less fortunates will be stuck with huge loans they can't repay. As people are cursing both [Root.GetLeader] and the [Root.GetAdjective] Central Bank for causing this, we must make an public statement on how we intend to handle this crisis fast."

Desperate financial moguls, their lobbyists, and the politicians they have made contributions to - all are swarming the [Root.GetAdjective] governing offices, and all have the same message: "We need a bailout!". \n \nApparently the dual shock of the Housing Downturn and the Stock Market Crash were too much for the financial sector to handle. The buildup of bad debts from their speculation is simply too great, there needs to be an inflow of fresh government money - or there will be bankruptcies across the board with innocent savers losing their deposits."

This pessimism is causing people to save more, and overall consumption is down. If this continues, a lot of businesses in [Root.GetName] will have to downsize or close down. Businesses that mainly exports [Root.GetAdjective] goods are however, not affected by this."

One theory is that we have become less competitive due to our relative high wages, another is that our competitors have increased the quality of their products. Others feel that the decrease in demand is just due to shifting trends abroad. Whatever the cause, there is not really much we can do about this except putting it behind us and working harder in the future."
 econvent.6.a:0 "Foreigners are being silly. [Root.GetAdjective] stuff is the best!"

 econvent.7.t:0 "Drought causes disaster for [Root.GetAdjective] farmers"
 econvent.7.d:0 "While we usually don't get much rain, the rainfall this growing season has been abysmal, with most crops failing. What little agricultural produce has been produced is entirely due to remaining rivers and artificial irrigation, something that is sadly not very common here in [Root.GetName]. Farmers are demanding aid from the [Root.GetLeader] Government, and city dwellers are getting worried about rising food prices."

However, the mother tried not only to flee from communism, but also from her husband, Gonzalez' father, who, still back in Cuba, now made demands to have the boy come back to him. \n\nThere can be no doubt from both an American and a Cuban standpoint that it would follow the law to send the young boy back to his father. But there are both moral and political implications here. Should we doom a young man to communistic oppression? Should we jeopardize the Cuban support for the Democratic Party in the vital key state of Florida? \n\nIt all comes down to Reno's verdict now."

Just like in 1990, California is the most populous state and Wyoming the least populated one. Every single state has grown in population, however the District of Columbia has seen a population decrease of 34,000.\nThe population, by ethnic self-classification, is 75% white, 12% hispanic, 12% black and 3% Asian. The largest group by descent from a single country are, as is custom since decades, the German Americans at about 12.4% of the population.\nThe census did not gather religious data (in accordance with the secular nature of the U.S. as per the First Amendment), however religion did play a role in the so-called "Utah Controversy", when the state of Utah, which failed to gain a fourth congressional seat by a margin of 80 people, tried to have most Mormons outside of Utah count as Utahns in order to gain the seat that now was given to North Carolina. Utah would later take the issue all the way to the Supreme Court in the case "Utah v. Evans", but ended up losing the case.\nThe population continues to age, with age brackets like 45 to 54 growing by 49% and the age bracket of 85 and older growing by 38%.\nWhen it comes to gender, women still outnumber men, especially because they outnumber men two to one in the 85 years and older bracket.\nSexual orientation, in compliance with policies like 'Don't ask, don't tell', was not documented - much to the dismay of gays and lesbians throughout the country."

The Republican primaries between January 24th and June 6th were a three-way competition between George W. Bush, Governor of Texas and son of former President George H. W. Bush, formally unknown Arizona senator John McCain and the Maryland-based African American conservative activist Alan Keyes.\n\nBush took an early lead due to Republican establishment support with notable supporters including George Shultz and Condoleezza Rice. However, a dominant victory in New Hampshire also gave McCain some prominence.\n\nMcCain ended up unable to use the momentum, winning only 7 contests (his home state Arizona as well as Michigan, Vermont, New Hampshire, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts). Keyes did even worse, not winning a single contest. The 43 other states as well as D.C. voted for George Bush, helped by McCain's withdrawal on March 9th.\n\nThe Republicans face a bit of ridicule because of the Bushs becoming a 'Presidential Dynasty' akin to the Democratic Kennedys, but George W. Bush has managed to rally a coalition of religious traditionalists, passionate conservatives and economic libertarians under his banner. It looks like Bush has a good chance to win."

 #Yemeni Events

 Yemen.4.t:0 "The War in Yemen has Ended"
 Yemen.4.d:0 "With the country in ruin, the Yemeni Civil War has finally concluded, granting victory to the Hadi-led government, backed by the Saudi Coalition. In the final days of the conflict, coalition forces managed to capture and destroy Houthi and Al-Qaeda ammo dumps, including the infamous Burkan 2-H scud missiles. Though many may still hold their loyalties to the Houthis, they have been disarmed, and in the coming days, the remaining Zaydi radicals will be rooted out and dealt with. Democracy has prevailed in the region with the help of the Saudi coalition and it's campaign, Restoring Hope, and the country of Yemen is on it's way to being rebuilt."
 Yemen.4.d2:0 "With the Hadi-led government reduced to rubble, the Houthi cause has found itself at the forefront of Yemen's future leadership. As was their goal, the Houthi's have managed to drive salafism and devotion to western ideologies from the region, and those who fought for it, as the Al-Qaeda and coalition forces lie in ruin. Now with the full responsibility of leading Yemen into the future, the Houthi government has begun the process of transforming from it's interrim state, and they have now embarked on the path of rebuilding the country. The Saudi coalition has withdrawn from the region, and has rendered Operation Restoring Hope, a complete and utter failure."
 Yemen.4.d3:0 "After years of fighting between the Yemeni government and the Houthi rebels, the most unlikely of all victors has emerged from the conflict. The remnants of Al-Qaeda in Yemen have found themselves as the architect of a new caliphate in the region, and have undergone a transformation for the future that will put all infidels in the region in danger. The Saudi coalition and Operation Restoring Hope has been a complete failure, and it's incompetence has failed to predict it's own defeat to an enemy it never new was this serious. The Jihadis have prevailed, and they have made it clear that this is only the beginning, and the rest of the world will soon realize what this new caliphate can do."
 Yemen.4.a:0 "Victory is finally ours..."
 Yemen.4.b:0 "But at what cost?"
 Yemen.4.c:0 "It could have been worse..."
 Yemen.4.e:0 "Interesting."
 Yemen.4.f:0 "Interesting."

 Yemen.6.t:0 "Fire missile at Riyadh?"
 Yemen.6.d:0 "Shooting a missile at the Saudi Capital will show the saudi's we're a force to be reckoned with."
 Yemen.6.a:0 "Do it!"
 Yemen.6.b:0 "Too dangerous"

 Yemen.7.t:0 "Houthis fire ballistic missile at Riyadh"
 Yemen.7.d:0 "Saudi-led coalition battling Yemen's Houthi rebels says it has intercepted a missile fired from the neighbouring country towards the kingdom's capital, Riyadh. Houthi rebels said on Tuesday they had launched a ballistic missile targeting al-Yamama royal palace to mark 1,000 days since the coalition started its bombing campaign in Yemen."
 Yemen.7.a:0 "Uh oh"

 Saleh.1.t:0 "The Houthi Power Struggle"
 Saleh.1.d:0 "The unlikely alliance between the Houthi rebels and Ali Abdullah Saleh's General People's Congress, has been on shaky ground since the day it was concieved. With help from our coalition members operating inside Yemen, we've discovered that former President Saleh has a growing discontent for the Houthi leadership, and rightly so. The Houthis oppose being effectively controlled by foreign powers, and seek to restore Yemen as it's own, completely independent entity free of salafism and western ideals. Saleh on the other hand, wants to restore Yemen as a free, united and democratic country, eager to participate in foreign affairs to an extent, though he does have his reasons to resent a number of western nations. This relationship is bound to boil over into a future conflict between the two parties, and it may be what the coalition needs."
 Saleh.1.a:0 "We don't have time for this..."
 Saleh.1.b:0 "Get President Saleh on the phone..."

 Saleh.2.t:0 "Saleh Suggests Coalition Dialogue"
 Saleh.2.d:0 "Ali Abdullah Saleh, the head of the General People's Congress aligned with the Houthi cause, is suggesting that the GPC and Houthi leadership open up talks with the Saudi-led coalition currently operating alongside President Hadi's Yemen. Though we very narrowly consider him an ally, it appears he has had a change of heart, and not in a good way. He now sternly suggests that the Houthi leadership come to a decision on whether or not this brutal civil war should continue. The likelihood of us coming out of these talks with something to gain is very small, and it could all very well be a ploy to remove us from power."
 Saleh.2.a:0 "Absolutely not!"
 Saleh.2.b:0 "It couldn't hurt..."

 Saleh.3.t:0 "Houthi Leaders are Willing to Talk"
 Saleh.3.d:0 "After pressure from the former Yemeni President, Ali Abdullah Saleh, the leaders of the Houthi insurgents in Sana'a are willing to try to come to terms with Hadi and our coalition."
 Saleh.3.a:0 "Well then, gather the coalition."
 Saleh.3.b:0 "This probably isn't a good idea..."

 Saleh.5.t:0 "Saleh Embarks on a Dangerous Path"
 Saleh.5.d:0 "After years of an indecisive and unstable alliance between Houthi and Republican forces, former Yemeni President, Ali Abdullah Saleh, held a speech directed at the Saudi-led coalition highlighting the so-called stupidity of the Houthi cause. Saleh stated that if the coalition were to lift their blockade and open the airports to ease the humanitarian effort, him and his republican forces were willing to pledge their allegiance to Saudi Arabia, declaring himself an enemy of our alliance. Saleh appeared fully committed in his most recent speech, and publically declared a new chapter in Yemen's history amidst this humanitarian crisis, as a united, free and democratic Yemen. The words of Saleh - I am going to fight the enemies of humanity and the enemies of our homeland who are trying hard to erase its identity and destroy its gains and humiliate the Yemenis!"
 Saleh.5.a:0 "Find this traitor..."
 Saleh.5.b:0 "He doesn't have the guts to do it..."

 Saleh.6.t:0 "Saleh is On The Run"
 Saleh.6.d:0 "After giving a series of treacherous speeches, Ali Abdullah Saleh has made it clear he no longer wishes to work alongside the Houthis. Abdul-Malik Al-Houthi knew of Saleh's approaching treachery, and he issued several warnings to him, all of which were not heeded. Abdul-Malik Al-Houthi declared this as a treasonous act, which subsequently led to Saleh's home in Sana'a being destroyed by Houthi mortar fire, and he is now fleeing the country. Houthi fighters have been hot on his trail, and they've managed to drive him into a potentially fatal trap south of Sana'a, where combat between the Houthi's and the coalition still rages. A number of fighters manning the front are prepared to pull back and intervene on your command."
 Saleh.6.a:0 "Pull the trigger..."
 Saleh.6.b:0 "Let him go..."

 Saleh.7.t:0 "The Supreme Political Council"
 Saleh.7.d:0 "With the war won, the time has come to rebuild our country that we fought so desperately to free from it's misguided leadership. Our associates from the Supreme Revolutionary Committee, an interim government that we had put in place amidst the civil war, remind us of their contribution to the war effort and urge us to carry out our original plan of dividing our presidential council equally between both parties. Let us remember that a number of these men were among those we started this fight against, and those we could not maintain a stable alliance with. We cannot forsee the future, but allowing them a seat in our parliament may very well lead us back into the uncertainty we sought to destroy."
 Saleh.7.a:0 "We fought to achieve this position, and we will fight to defend it"
 Saleh.7.b:0 "Nonsense, we will rebuild our nation together"

 Saleh.8.t:0 "Houthi Leadership Denies Saleh's Suggestion"
 Saleh.8.d:0 "After our talk with former Yemeni president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, he made an effort to convince the Houthi leadership to come to a conclusion on whether or not this war of theirs should continue. As we expected, he was rejected without a second thought. The Houthis appear to be beyond adamant on the topic of continuing their war effort to overthrow the democratic government of Yemen. This has worn on on the alliance between Saleh's General People's Congress and the Houthi rebels, and if we push Saleh harder, he may be willing to finally severe ties with the misguided cause."
 Saleh.8.a:0 "We must try harder!"
 Saleh.8.b:0 "Forget it..."

 Saleh.9.t:0 "Saleh Persists"
 Saleh.9.d:0 "Ali Abdullah Saleh once again, suggests that we open up talks with the Saudi-led coalition, who I must remind you, is our enemy. It is true that our alliance with the GPC has always been in a critical state, but this persistence by Saleh has not appeared out of thin air, he must have a motive. It would not be crazy to believe that the Saudi-led coalition is in contact with him, we must watch this closely."
 Saleh.9.a:0 "This might actually be a good idea..."
 Saleh.9.b:0 "Ali, stop this immediately, or else"
 Saleh.9.c:0 "Mr. Saleh, may I have a word with you?"

 HOU_Saleh.1:0 "Ali Abdullah Saleh will be pursued by Houthi fighters."
 HOU_Saleh.2:0 "Ali Abdullah Saleh will be contacted about bringing the Yemeni Civil War to an end, with our help. Whether that be through diplomacy or brute force, we must convince him to attend a dialogue with our coalition."
 HOU_Saleh.3:0 "Our alliance has never been as strong as would be ideal, but I do value our allegiance, though it may not seem this way. I understand that you want a conclusion to this war, but unfortunately I cannot allow myself or my comrades to deal with this devil of a coalition. Surely you understand?"
 HOU_Saleh.4:0 "Ali is disappointed."
 HOU_Saleh.5:0 "Ali will be contacted once more."
 HOU_Saleh.6:0 "Ali visibly recoils, and exits the room."
 HOU_Saleh.7:0 "Ali will be contacted again, but let this be the final warning to him that if he remains aligned with our enemy, he too will be treated as an enemy."

 Saleh.10.t:0 "Saleh is Wasting Our Time..."
 Saleh.10.d:0 "Once again, the leader of the General People's Congress aligned with the Houthi rebels,  Ali Abdullah Saleh, was denied by the Houthi leadership to commence peace talks with our coalition. It has been clear from the beginning that the Houthi leadership will not speak with us, as they see us as a sworn enemy. With the GPC-Houthi alliance as critical as it is, we must deliver Ali Abdullah Saleh an ultimatum immediately. Without him, the Houthis governing parties will be in shambles without proper skill and talent behind it. With him, the leadership has competence, though it lacks a certain ability when it comes to progress, but it could potentially carry the Houthis to victory."
 Saleh.10.a:0 "He either takes action, or we cannot guarantee his safety."
 Saleh.10.b:0 "This is pointless..."

 Saleh.11.t:0 "The General People's Congress Defects!"
 Saleh.11.d:0 "Even after numerous occasions in which Saleh's Republican forces have exchanged fire with ours, we've formally remained allies. No longer, these traitors have officially declared themselves as our enemy after their treasonous leader, Ali Abdullah Saleh, was rightfully disposed of. The GPC and it's troops are actively engaging in firefights with us in the streets of our cities, we must put a stop to this at once."
 Saleh.11.a:0 "Traitors! I should have seen this coming!"

 Saleh.12.t:0 "Former Yemeni President, Ali Abdullah Saleh Assassinated!"
 Saleh.12.d:0 "This day is considered a major victory for the Houthi cause, as the man who sought to tear them apart from the inside, has now been defeated. It was long believed by the Houthis that Saleh had been in contact with the Saudi-led coalition, but it wasn't until recently that Mr. Saleh had shown his true colors to the Houthis, and attempted to side with the coalition by declaring a new chapter of unification and democracy in Yemen. This struck a great ire in the Houthis, and with Saleh gone, they claim that their morale is soaring."
 Saleh.12.a:0 "Good work boys."
 Saleh.12.b:0 "This is troubling..."
 Saleh.12.c:0 "Interesting."

 Saleh.13.t:0 "Saleh Renews GPC-Houthi Alliance"
 Saleh.13.d:0 "The leader of the General People's Congress, a long-time Houthi ally, though not on the greatest of terms, has declared a renewal of the once divided alliance. Ali Abdullah Saleh publically announced a new chapter in Yemen's future, a chapter in which the GPC and Houthis will work together to restore the ruined nation. Saleh gave one condition, and that was that the Houthi leadership formalizes the Supreme Political Council, an interim government put in place in the time of war, and split the rulership between the two alliances, as was originally planned."
 Saleh.13.a:0 "Is this good? I can't tell."
 Saleh.13.b:0 "Damn!"

 Saleh.14.t:0 "The Coalition Gathers"
 Saleh.14.d:0 "The Houthi leadership opposing the democratic, Hadi-led government in Yemen, has shown that they are willing to come to the table and talk about the humanitarian situation currently ongoing in Yemen. Saudi Arabia, the leader of the coalition operating in Yemen, has invited all of it's members to a diplomatic summit being held in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. The special guests will be Abdul-Malik Al-Houthi himself, along with his associate, Ali Abdullah Saleh."
 Saleh.14.a:0 "We must attend."
 Saleh.14.b:0 "Sorry, we don't have time for this."
 Saleh.14.c:0 "We would be honoured to host this summit."

 Saleh.15.t:0 "The Summit Commences"
 Saleh.15.d:0 "Those that chose to attend that summit take their seats, and await the beginning of the discussion. The Houthis have mentioned that they are not coming into this discussion with the intent to just surrender, so we must sway them to see the conflict from an outsider's shoes. This war in Yemen has been one of the greatest humanitarian crises in recent memory, and it would benefit all parties for the war to be put to a halt as soon as possible. To make this quick, let us share our demands..."
 Saleh.15.a:0 "Surrender and return all territories to Yemen's rightful government."
 Saleh.15.b:0 "Cease the conflict immediately, and both states shall remain independent."
 Saleh.15.c:0 "All Houthi claimed land shall be declared an Arabian state."

 Saleh.16.t:0 "The Coalition Demands Surrender"
 Saleh.16.d:0 "We were invited to this summit in Abu Dhabi to discuss a potential end to the war we have been fighting for years now, and we have come to the realization that this was all a waste of time. We were immediately greeted by an absurd demand as soon as the summit had started, that demand being our full surrender. But, as long as the war still rages, people will continue to die and cities will continue to be destroyed. Ending the war may be for the better, but it would mean capitulating to our sworn enemies."
 Saleh.16.a:0 "This war must end, so we must oblige."
 Saleh.16.b:0 "Ridiculous! This discussion ends now!"

 Saleh.17.t:0 "The Coalition Demands both States Remain Independent"

This caused the ex-fighters to go on a reign of terror in the country, igniting the civil war.\n\nDespite being predominantly Muslim (thus representing only a tenth of the population), the group still has managed to once again gain control of the country.

 Egypt.1.t:0 "el-Kosheh Massacre"
 Egypt.1.d:0 "The el-Kosheh Massacre was a terrorist attack that occurred on Sunday, January 2 in the village el-Kosheh in Upper Egypt, 450 kilometers south of Cairo.\n\nThe Coptic Christian minority living in North Eastern Africa has always had a difficult relationship with radical Muslims living among the Islamic majority populations. el-Kosheh was a local economic center in Sohag governorate with a population of about 35,000 and a majority Coptic population - a fact that did not save the local civilians from militant attackers. After a religious conflict between a Christian shop owner and a Muslim customer, the Muslim community of the village was outraged into a frenzy and began looting and pillaging Christian shops and storefronts, mainly in the outskirts of the city in el-Kosheh village, a good distance away from the city of Kosheh.\n\nThis massacre was one of the largest in Egypt's history and calls the efficiency of our majority-Muslim government into action. The pope of the Coptic church has already called this a tragedy of martyrdom and declared the 21 massacred Christian martyrs. What should the government of Egypt do?"

This, in the eyes of critics, does not only discriminate against foreigners of non-Christian belief, but also the small catholic and orthodox communities of Sweden.\n\nThere is no real power held by the Church of Sweden anymore.

This as of now, is an unconfirmed suspicion but the idea should remain a point of interest, given that the PKK is no stranger to showing it's support for their fellow Kurds through violent attacks. The attack itself happened quickly and appeared to be thoroughly planned by the terrorists as their targeting and haste showed a level of deliberation, according to a security unit who was on the scene during the shootout. \n\nReports claim that two trucks and what appeared to be eight men stopped on a major overpass that bridges over a main highway that security forces often use to exit the downtown area. Gunfire aimed at two security trucks quickly erupted from the overpass killing at least three security forces and injuring one. Another casualty was reported as the gunmen on the overpass hurled an explosive toward one of the trucks, destroying the vehicle and bursting it into flames."

However, the island group was granted to Spain the same year and the British colonists left eight years later. Spain formally stopped colonial investments in the island group in 1811 in the context of the Napoleonic Wars and the threat of independence movements - including the Argentinian one - in Latin America.\n\nThe Argentinians took the Falklands (calling them 'Islas Mavlinas' in Spanish) in 1820, establishing a settlement there. The UK returned to the archipelago in 1833 by establishing a naval outpost and naming it a colony in 1837 - much to the dismay of the Argentinians. Since then, the Falklands were under continued British rule with an ever-increasing amount of British settlers - up until April 2nd, 1982, when Argentina's military junta tried to fight popular discontent with the government with an external political victory - the occupation of the Falklands. The British government responded (much to the surprise of Argentina) with military action. The subsequent Falkland War ended on June 20th with total British victory and a return to the status quo ante bellum.\n\nThe Argentinians were not deterred and still claim the islands even after the end of their junta.
