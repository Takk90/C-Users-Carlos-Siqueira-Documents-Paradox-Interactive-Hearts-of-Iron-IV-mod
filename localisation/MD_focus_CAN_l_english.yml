 canada.100.t: "Air Canada acquires Canadian Airlines"
 canada.100.d: "Canadian Airlines is a struggling Canadian airline that, due to economic hardships, is not longer able to compete with its rival Air Canada.\n\nAir Canada bureaucrats have now presented a plan to integrate their former main rival into the company. The plan seems to be comprehensive and be able to save most of the jobs that are threatened by Canadian Airlines possibly going bankrupt - the takeover, to be agreed upon on January 4th, 2000, is to go into effect on January 1st, 2001."
 canada.100.a: "Sounds like a good proposal."

Almost 60% of Canadas core public infrastructure is owned and maintained by municipal governments. According to survey results, the total value of core municipal infrastructure assets is estimated at $1.1 trillion dollars, or about $80,000 per household. We must start moving towards a new federal based infrastructure system. "

 ###Canadian Political Events
 ##The Clarity Act
 canada_md_politics.1.t: "The Clarity Act"
 canada_md_politics.1.d: "One issue brought up with the 1995 Quebec referendum was that the federalists won by less than a percent. Sovereigntists in Quebec began challenging the close defeat they suffered, but this brought on many questions regarding how secession is supposed to work in the first place. Later, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that no province can unilaterally secede Canada under domestic and international law. They also suggested that a clear majority is indeed required for succession without explicitly mentioning the number of votes required to reach that goal.\n Regardless, the questions were answered. The government has now put forward legislation which states the federal government can examine the clarity of a referendum question, consider any question not solely referring to independence as unclear, and decide if a clear majority has been reached after a referendum has concluded. Furthermore, all provinces and indigenous groups must be part of succession negotiations, the federal government can override a referendum result which violates the contents of this bill, and that a constitutional amendment is required for succession to take place. All these points make succession harder to achieve than ever, but nobody can argue that they do not make sense."
 canada_md_politics.1.a: "Hopefully the Sovereigntists drop their act when this is passed."
 canada_md_politics.1.b: "We have no right to impose legislation like this on Quebec."
 ##OP Yellow Ribbion
 canada_md_politics.2.t: "Operation Yellow Ribbon"
 canada_md_politics.2.d: "A coordinated attack appears to have been made on the World Trade Center in New York City. Other threats may still be looming in the air, and this has resulted in the United States closing its airspace. We must follow their lead to prevent further attacks on potential targets. Transport Canada and Nav Canada will activate their emergency measures to ground all aircraft flying over both American airspace and our own. Pilots will need to land at the closest possible airfields excluding those near large urban areas. Each aircraft must be screened upon landing, and thousands of passengers have to get through customs. Support from the public is necessary to provide food and shelter to everyone left stranded. This is sure to be a massive undertaking."
 canada_md_politics.2.a: "United We Stand"
 canada_md_politics.2.b: "Send the USA Everything we Can Spare!"
 ##Softwood Lumber Dispute
 canada_md_politics.3.t: "Another Softwood Lumber Dispute"
 canada_md_politics.3.d: "Here we go again with a fourth dispute over softwood lumber. The United States has picked yet another fight over it. Our provincial governments are unfairly subsidizing our lumber industry according to them. Timber is owned by the provinces, so they set the prices. Our markets operate somewhat differently from what the Americans are used to. In any case, they have laws allowing them to set tariffs on us to “even the playing field” as they call it. We can probably put an end to this nonsense once and for all by bringing in the World Trade Organization. However, that carries the risk of angering the Americans and causing this issue to go beyond just lumber."
 canada_md_politics.3.a: "Contacting the World Trade Organization will lead to an easy win."
 canada_md_politics.3.b: "We can try for new deal with them rather than start a trade war."
 ##Ontario Goes Dark
 canada_md_politics.4.t: "Ontario Goes Dark"
 canada_md_politics.4.d: "It would appear that 10 million Ontarians and 45 million Americans have lost power. This is looking like the second most widespread blackout in world history if our numbers add up correctly. However, we have to put statistics aside for now. Cities from Windsor to Ottawa need support. Toronto in particular is struggling with all the public transportation in the city put to a halt. Premier Ernie Eves has issued a state of emergency, and we can expect help to arrive in the affected areas soon. Thankfully, some upstanding citizens have already taken on the responsibility of directing traffic and getting people to safety until police arrive. We are working with the United States to investigate what happened, but the cause remains unclear at the moment."
 canada_md_politics.4.a: "It was the Americans"
 canada_md_politics.4.b: "We Really Need to Improve our Infrastructure"
 #The Sponsorship Scandal
 canada_md_politics.5.t: "The Sponsorship Scandal"
 canada_md_politics.5.d: "In 1996, the Liberals began a sponsorship program which promoted the Canadian government’s contributions to Quebec’s industries to counter sovereigntist sentiments. However, it would seem that the money was not being put to good use. Auditor General Sheila Fraser just finished a report on the program, and it has been revealed to the nation that almost half of the $250 million program was spent on corporations friendly to the Liberals. Some of the money would even end up donated back to the Liberals for use in election campaigns. Prime Minister Paul Martin is doing everything he can to reduce the hit his party’s popularity will take, but it appears that the next election might already be decided."
 canada_md_politics.5.a: "We can reach a settlement and enact legislation to ban programs like these."
 canada_md_politics.5.b: "Liberals always seem to find themselves in some kind of scandal."
 #American Nuclear Submarines in the Northwest Passage
 canada_md_politics.6.t: "American Nuclear Submarines in the Northwest Passage"
 canada_md_politics.6.d: "The USS Charlotte has reportedly arrived in Virginia after taking a northern route from Pearl Harbor. Usually, the US Navy is not a concern to us. However, the route this submarine took cuts straight through the Northwest Passage. We see this region as part of our internal waters, but the United States does not share this opinion. This presents a problem that will only continue to grow in the future. More nations will want to use the Northwest Passage as a shipping route as it becomes easier to navigate. Our northern rivals such as Russia may also feel like they have free access to our northern waters. This must come to an end."
 canada_md_politics.6.a: "The presence of foreign states in our territorial waters will not be tolerated."
 canada_md_politics.6.b: "We will let it go."
 #The Toronto 18
 canada_md_politics.7.t: "The Toronto 18"
 canada_md_politics.7.d: "A horrid terrorist plot has just been uncovered in the Greater Toronto Area. Counter-terrorism raids have arrested 14 adults and 4 youths who have been dubbed the Toronto 18. All of them are accused of planning coordinated attacks across Southern Ontario. These attacks would have involved bombing cultural landmarks, opening fire on crowds in the streets of Toronto, taking out power grids, invading the Canadian Broadcasting Centre, storming the headquarters of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, and even launching an assault on Parliament Hill. Perhaps most disturbing was their goal of beheading the Prime Minister and other politicians on live television. We always remind the public to never fall victim to fear. However, the possibility of an attack like this being even remotely possible is frightening."
 canada_md_politics.7.a: "Strip these heartless monsters of their citizenship"
 canada_md_politics.7.b: "Our actions in the Middle East might lead to catastrophe here at home."
 #Operation Medusa Commences
 canada_md_politics.8.t: "Operation Medusa Commences"
 canada_md_politics.8.d: "The struggle for Kandahar Province continues in Afghanistan, and we are about to lead the largest land battle ever undertaken in NATO’s history. We enter this fight with our Afghan, American, British, Danish, and Dutch allies. This operation will surely be successful, but our troops must remain cautious against the Taliban. Opposing us are thousands of militants prepared to die for this land. It is unlikely that we will be able to completely push them out of the region so soon. This has many Canadians worried about the casualties our side may suffer in this conflict. After all, the death toll can only rise from here. How smoothly this operation goes will affect the public’s perception of the war."
 canada_md_politics.8.a: "We have to finish this fight, and that means eliminating the Taliban."
 canada_md_politics.8.b: "There will only be more Canadian blood on our hands from here."
 #Quebecois Nation Motion
 canada_md_politics.9.t: "Quebecois Nation Motion"
 canada_md_politics.9.d: "Prime Minister Stephen Harper has put forward a motion in the House of Commons regarding Quebec. It calls for the House of Commons to recognize that the Quebecois form a distinct society within Canada. Each party seems to be showing a large amount of support for this motion, but the Canadian public is divided down the middle. Some say that this only serves to revive separatist sentiments, and that Quebec does not deserve special treatment. Others see this as a positive step forward in Canada’s relationship with Quebec by recognizing the things that make their province unique. In any case, motions in the House have no real effect on the law regardless of the outcome."
 canada_md_politics.9.a: "Canada is indivisible, and Quebec is like any other province."
 canada_md_politics.9.b: "Quebec must have their differences recognized and respected."
 #Indigenous Day of Action
 canada_md_politics.10.t: "Indigenous Day of Action"
 canada_md_politics.10.d: "Canadian First Nations across the country have become increasingly disillusioned with their relationship to the federal government. Today, they have marked the first national day of protest to bring attention to the issues they face. Major transportation routes in many major cities have been blockaded. The activists there are calling for action on issues with land claims, the quality of life on reservations, and social service programs available to them. One of their most pressing concerns is the cancellation of the Kelowna Accord by Prime Minister Stephen Harper. It was a series of agreements between the federal government and indigenous peoples which sought to improve education, employment, and living conditions through government-sponsored programs. The accord was not legally binding, but this is a step back for indigenous relations regardless."
 canada_md_politics.10.a: "Bring back the Kelowna Accord and commit to it this time."
 canada_md_politics.10.b: "These people should just accept that the world has changed."
 #RCMP Raid on Conservative Headquarters
 canada_md_politics.11.t: "RCMP Raid on Conservative Headquarters"
 canada_md_politics.11.d: "The Conservatives have been accused of illegally surpassing the number of funding parties are allowed to use on advertising during the last election. Some loopholes were found in the laws on how transactions must be done between different organizations in a party, and the Conservatives used them to funnel lots of money into local advertisements that were not national in scope. Elections Canada is normally supposed to refund some of a party’s expenses in each riding based on the votes they received, but they withheld this due to the scandal. Today, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police raided the Conservative headquarters in search of documents pertaining to the illegal funding. Both the Liberals and NDP are now using this as an opportunity to attack corruption brought on by the Conservatives."
 canada_md_politics.11.a: "Settle things with Elections Canada quickly to get this out of the public eye."
 canada_md_politics.11.b: "There is no way we can win the next election at this rate."
 #End of the Great Recession in Canada
 canada_md_politics.12.t: "The Great Recession is Over!"
 canada_md_politics.12.d: "We were one of the last industrialized nations to enter a recession, but now we are one of the first to get out. This can be attributed to our strong banking sector and an economic focus on resources rather than services. We also lack the consumer debt issues faced by the United States. Speaking of the Americans, we are now in a very strong position compared to them economically. Their economy collapsed from within while our own was only hurt through our trade relationship. We now have a fantastic opportunity to promote our businesses due to a strong dollar and a falling unemployment rate. How exactly we should proceed is still a question to be answered though"
 canada_md_politics.12.a:  "Push American Markets while they are down!"
 canada_md_politics.12.b:  "Promote Local Business"
 #The Golden Goal
 canada_md_politics.13.t: "The Golden Goal
 canada_md_politics.13.d: "It is the closing day of the 2010 Winter Olympics, and all eyes were set on the final event. The Canadian men’s hockey team had made it to the finals. Only the United States stood in the way of gold. Canada had a strong start at a 2-0 score, but the Americans managed to even the odds with 25 seconds left in the third period. The entire stadium grew tense as sudden death began. Eventually, Jarome Iginla made a pass to Sidney Crosby who then scored the game-winning goal. Cities across Canada immediately erupted with cheering as if the entire nation had come together as one."
 canada_md_politics.13.a: "Something for the History Books"
 canada_md_politics.13.b: "Wasted Money"
 #G20 Riots in Toronto
 canada_md_politics.14.t: "G20 Summit Riots"
 canada_md_politics.14.d: "The G20 convened in Toronto for the first summit of 2010, and everything was meant to go smoothly. Canada recovered swiftly from the global financial crisis, and this led us to some great opportunities during the meetings. However, there was a massive problem outside the venue. G20 summits seem to attract the attention of many political activists. All the world’s most influential leaders are gathered in one place, and this is a chance for them to have their voices heard. Thousands showed up on the streets to peacefully protest against a perceived lack of transparency and care for public opinion. Rioters among them took advantage of the large crowds to vandalize buildings, loot shops, and set some vehicles ablaze. Many riot police were sent out to put an end to the anarchy, but a lack of leadership lead to some violent clashes involving innocent bystanders. Over a thousand people were detained, and that number makes this the largest mass arrest in Canadian history."
 canada_md_politics.14.a: "Embarrassing"
 canada_md_politics.14.b: "It Could've Been Worse Without Our Security"
 #Wuthdrawing the Securiy Council Bid
 canada_md_politics.15.t: "Withdrawing the Security Council Bid"
 canada_md_politics.15.d: "Canada was a founding member of the United Nations, and continues to be one of the most involved. This involvement once included a record of winning every single bid made for a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council. Our record just got shattered. The first round saw Germany demolish us in votes, and the second had us lose to Portugal. We decided to withdraw at this point, and Portugal’s membership was confirmed in the third round. Many Canadians are upset with this loss, and blame it on the Conservative administration’s foreign policy. Lately, Canada has been intervening much more than usual on the world stage alongside NATO allies. We have followed the US in particular into many battles on foreign soil. Perhaps we must change our approach"
 canada_md_politics.15.a: "We are only defending our values for a safer world"
 canada_md_politics.15.b: "This is an attack on our reputation!"
 #An Orange Wave
 canada_md_politics.16.t: "An Orange Wave"
 canada_md_politics.16.d: "Recent polls for the upcoming election suggest that the NDP have gained more support than the Liberals. Their party has been in third place since its inception, but now it seems to be within reach of forming a government. Jack Layton, their charismatic leader, can be credited with this. He is a champion of progressive causes, and has made his biggest push for Prime Minister yet. Many NDP candidates are veteran politicians from other parties who have been moved by his vision. Canadians across the country have been showing widespread support for his platform as well. This could be the first government in Canadian history to not be formed by Conservatives or Liberals."
 canada_md_politics.16.a: "Ignore these hopefuls. Focus on the real competition!"
 canada_md_politics.16.b: "We must act before Layton takes power!"
 #war of 1812 Bicentennial
 canada_md_politics.17.t: "War of 1812 Bicentennial"
 canada_md_politics.17.d: "Today marks two hundred years since the United States declared war on the British Empire. It was a war that helped shape Canada’s national identity, and the current Conservative administration under Harper is doing everything it can to remind Canadians of that. Millions of dollars have been spent over the past three years to create commemorative coins, historical reenactments, and promotional videos. Not many can argue that teaching youth about our past is a bad thing, but the high cost of the bicentennial compared to similar events has raised eyebrows."
 canada_md_politics.17.a: "Everyone will know the Canadians who defended our freedom"
 canada_md_politics.17.b: "The war wasn't even worth it."
 #International Space Expedition 35
 canada_md_politics.18.t: "International Space Station Expedition 35"
 canada_md_politics.18.d: "Colonel Chris Hadfield has returned from the International Space Station. He was the first astronaut with the Canadian Space Agency to be put in command of the station. Not only is he highly accomplished but he also attracted a massive social media presence. Hadfield often streamed videos to children across the nation to show them what life in space is like. Sometimes he would host online sessions where the internet could ask him anything. He even created a music video on the ISS of him singing Space Oddity by David Bowie. Now he is preparing to publish an autobiography recounting  his experiences in space due later this year."
 canada_md_politics.18.a: "Award him all the nation’s honors for his service, and get us a copy of that book"
 canada_md_politics.18.b: "He has inspired the next generation of Canadian astronauts."
 #Negotiations with the EU on CETA Conclude
 canada_md_politics.19.t: "Negotiations with the European Union on CETA Conclude"
 canada_md_politics.19.d: "Our efforts to diversify the list of our trade partners has resulted in many new free trade opportunities. The Comprehensive Economic and Trade agreement with the European Union might be our biggest trade deal yet. Our markets will open to 28 nations when this is ratified. However, the deal is not without controversy. There are growing concerns to do with the terms on intellectual property laws, genetically modified organisms, and visa restrictions between the two signatories. Newfoundland and Labrador in particular is upset with the way the enforcement of our exclusive economic zone will be altered. Some rules which protected fisheries in the maritimes are now being dropped to appease the Europeans, and this stings after we had fought Turbot War against them in 1994. Nonetheless, we managed a good deal overall considering the economic powerhouse that the European Union is."
 canada_md_politics.19.a: "Open our nation to European investment"
 canada_md_politics.19.b: "Enter the European markets with force"
 #Terror in the Capital
 canada_md_politics.20.t: "Terror in the Capital"
 canada_md_politics.20.d: "Ottawa is currently under lockdown after a lone gunman attempted an attack on the government. It began with him fatally wounding a sentry named Corporal Nathan Cirilo at the National War Memorial. He then made his way to the Parliament, and entered the Centre Block through the main entrance under the Peace Tower. Many Members of Parliament were holding meetings at the time, and were gathered in rooms that the gunman happened to run past. Prime Minister Stephen Harper was in one of these rooms, and was forced to hide in a closet as his fellow party members grabbed flagpoles to defend themselves. The gunman shot some rounds as he made his way through the halls, and one bullet flew into the room the NDP were gathered in. Eventually, the RCMP managed to corner the gunman behind a column. Sergeant-at-Arms Kevin Vickers dove past the gunman while firing at him, and Constable Curtis Barrett reportedly shot the fatal bullet. Already, news stations around the world have begun sensationalizing this event with reports of the city being under siege. Even calmer reporters are questioning the lack of security on Parliament Hill. Perhaps the Americans were right to increase surveillance as much as they did after facing terror attacks of their own"
 canada_md_politics.20.a: "Canadians have never been known to lock their doors, and terrorits won't change that"
 canada_md_politics.20.b: "We must protect Canadians even if it comes at the cost of some freedoms."
 #Airstrikes in Syria and Iraq
 canada_md_politics.21.t: "Airstrikes in Iraq and Syria"
 canada_md_politics.21.d: "The Liberals have just won an election with the promise of ending our airstrikes on the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. What they want to do instead is put more effort into training our allies on the ground to build a more effective fighting force. One reason for this move is that it will save costs, as we have already spent hundreds of millions on our combat operations. Another is that Canadians would not have to put their lives at risk if local forces were able to handle their own battles. There is some merit to both these arguments, but we risk upsetting our NATO allies. Other nations might get the impression that we are making them do all the heavy lifting."
 canada_md_politics.21.a: "We must remain committed to our allies"
 canada_md_politics.21.b: "There are better ways to support the fight against the Islamic State"
 #The Case of Omar Khadr
 canada_md_politics.22.t: "The Case of Omar Khadr"
 canada_md_politics.22.d: "Omar Khadr has become quite a divisive figure in the nation. His father took him to Afghanistan as a boy, and he ended up fighting on the side of Al-Qaeda along with other terrorist groups during the war. He was wounded in a battle against American forces, and allegedly killed a Sergeant 1st Class by the name of Christopher Speer with a grenade. Later, he was captured and sent to Guantanamo Bay where he was interrogated by American and Canadian intelligence officers. In 2010, he pled guilty to war crimes after 8 years in custody. He returned to Canada to serve the rest of his term here. Controversy arose from his treatment at Guantanamo Bay. The UN has found that he is the first person since World War II to be prosecuted for war crimes as a minor. Civil rights activists across the nation voiced disdain for the actions of our intelligence services, and the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that they violated his human rights. Khadr was released on bail in 2015, but the Conservatives sought to appeal this decision. The new Liberal administration is now considering dropping this appeal. Canadians will surely react negatively either way this goes."
 canada_md_politics.22.a: "He was just a boy, when his father dragged him into the arms of terrorists"
 canada_md_politics.22.b: "We cannot allow him to freely walk on our streets after everything he has done."
 #Fate of the  Bombardier CSeries
 canada_md_politics.23.t: "Fate of the Bombardier CSeries"
 canada_md_politics.23.d: "Our aerospace industry is hurting, and that has led to some desperate measures by Bombardier. Their newest passenger jet, the CSeries, fills a niche in the market which could potentially bring them fortune. However, not many companies have been buying these jets. In response, Bombardier slashed the price on each well below the production cost to make them more enticing. Each jet is being sold for $19 million despite costing $33 million to produce. Boeing did not like this one bit, as it presented tough competition for their MAX 7. Thus, they filed a petition against Bombardier. It is somewhat hypocritical that they are accusing Bombardier of unfair economic advantages when they themselves receive massive tax breaks from the American government. Nonetheless, this could be a death blow to our aerospace industry. It does not help that the current American administration has been accusing us of taking advantage of our trade relationship. Luckily, Europe has come to our aid. Airbus wants to acquire a majority stake in the CSeries program in exchange for exclusive benefits to Canada. The Europeans are trustworthy allies, but we will not be nearly as independent in this industry if we take the offer."
 canada_md_politics.23.a: "Better we work with the Europeans than kneel to the Americans."
 canada_md_politics.23.b: "Selling out to Europe solves nothing"
 #The USA wants to renegotiate NAFTA
 canada_md_politics.24.t: "The United States Announces Intent to Renegotiate NAFTA"
 canada_md_politics.24.d: "President Donald Trump made it very clear in his campaign platform that he is not a fan of NAFTA. Now, his administration has made this official by announcing their intent to totally overhaul the trade agreement. Both our own government and our counterparts in Mexico have been expecting this. Trump will not make negotiations easy, but there is a fallback plan for us which does not exist for the Mexicans. NAFTA was the successor to the Canada-United States Free Trade Agreement, and terminating it might just lead to us defaulting back to the terms in that deal. Of course, we will do our best to negotiate a new agreement which works for all three nations. Falling back to CUSFTA can be considered our backup plan."
 canada_md_politics.24.a: "We cannot abandon the Mexicans, and working with them is the only way to beat Trump."
 canada_md_politics.24.b: "Even a united front will be unable to sway the Americans"
 #Plans to increase military spending
 canada_md_politics.25.t: "Even a united front will be unable to sway the Americans"
 canada_md_politics.25.d: "Our military and allies in NATO have been persistently asking our administration to spend more on security. They make a good argument too. Our military has been struggling to keep up with the times these past few decades. Hardware is outdated, and recruitment is on the decline. We have also been deploying our forces to an increasing number of conflict zones overseas. Our sovereignty in the north will also need to be protected as the ice continues to melt. Defense minister Harjit Sajjan has put forward a new defense policy to tackle these concerns. It calls for an overhaul of the military over the next 20 years, and this includes a 73% increase to spending over the next decade. This plan will be costly, and it is unclear where all the resources necessary will come from."
 canada_md_politics.25.a: "Canada must do more to protect herself and her allies."
 canada_md_politics.25.b: "The military is capable enough already."
 #Canada Celebrates 150 years
 canada_md_politics.26.t: "Canada 150 Celebrations"
 canada_md_politics.26.d: "It has been 150 years since Canadian Confederation. The federal and provincial governments are hosting the largest celebrations in the country’s history. Shows are being put on, national parks are free to access, and commemorative coins have been minted. We also have a giant duck swimming around Lake Ontario. Some of our friends across the world have sent gifts too. The Dutch have bred a tulip that looks just like the Maple Leaf flag. Despite all this, not everyone is excited today. Some are criticizing the high cost of the festivities, and they would rather see the money put elsewhere.
